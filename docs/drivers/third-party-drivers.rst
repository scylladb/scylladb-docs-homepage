Third-party Drivers
=========================

ScyllaDB supports the CQL binary protocol version 4, so any Apache Cassandra/CQL
driver that implements the same version works with ScyllaDB.

However, we recommend using :doc:`ScyllaDB drivers </drivers/cql-drivers>`.
All ScyllaDB drivers are shard-aware and provide additional benefits over
third-party drivers.
