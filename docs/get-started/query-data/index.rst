Query Data
========================

To effectively query data in ScyllaDB, you should understand its schema and how 
to perform basic operations like insert, read, update, and delete. 
To perform these basic operations, you will use CQL.

.. note::

  If you are looking to query data with a DynamoDB compatible API, we recommend using `ScyllaDB Alternator <https://opensource.docs.scylladb.com/stable/alternator/getting-started.html>`_.
