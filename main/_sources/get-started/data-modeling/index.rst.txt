Data Modeling
===============

Data modeling is the process of defining the structure and relationships of 
your data in ScyllaDB. It involves making important decisions about how data 
will be organized, stored, and retrieved.

Data modeling in NoSQL database such as ScyllaDB differs from traditional 
relational databases. 

A practical approach when data modeling for ScyllaDB is to adopt a query-first 
data model, where you design your data model around the queries that it needs 
to execute.
